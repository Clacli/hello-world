# hello-world
My first repo

A strange mix. Not young anymore, herbalist, young (as a) coder.
No more procrastination. 
After a few months of no coding at all, doing a completely different and time adsorbing job, I started programming again.
I've been learning Flutter for some months now and even if I haven't been able to dedicate to this as much time and attention I wanted to, due to life circumstances, I've stuck to it, I like it and I definetly want to create something with it.
My future missions: learning to use Git and GitHub correctly, seriously resuming Python and web development, finding a payed job, spreading correct and meaningful information on herbalism, herbal medicine, medicinal plants used for health in a mindful and safe way, the history of their use.
Will I manage?
